1
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:10,829
<i>Kids, on my first day
as a college professor,</i>

2
00:00:10,952 --> 00:00:12,422
<i>there were two things
I didn't know</i>

3
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:14,360
<i>that I wish I did.</i>

4
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:18,241
<i>The first thing was that your
mother was in that classroom.</i>

5
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:23,178
The second thing?

6
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:25,527
<i>Well, to explain that
we have to go back</i>

7
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:26,898
<i>to the beginning of the summer.</i>

8
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:28,348
<i>When, after a year of wrestling</i>

9
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:29,855
<i>with their feelings
for each other,</i>

10
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:33,417
<i>Barney and Robin
finally, well...</i>

11
00:00:33,418 --> 00:00:35,758
Whoo!
Lily, volume.

12
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,414
Use your indoor "whoo."

13
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:38,751
Sorry, whoo!

14
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:40,087
It's just, they kissed!

15
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:41,726
They're finally a couple.

16
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:43,231
Oh, my God, you guys!

17
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:46,105
This is our first double date!

18
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:47,208
First of millions!

19
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:48,679
What if our kids get married?!

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,918
Oh, I love this!

21
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:52,828
Yeah... Lily, listen.

22
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:54,958
Barney's awesome.

23
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:57,529
Robin is more than
just awe- "some."

24
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,167
She's a... "quite a bit."

25
00:00:59,168 --> 00:01:01,608
She's a... "a whole darn lot."

26
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:03,146
Wait, what are you saying?

27
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:05,988
We're just not
feeling it right now.

28
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:07,727
But we'll totally still
be friends. Oh, yeah.

29
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:11,538
Is it something I did?

30
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,577
Oh, no, no, no, no, God, no. No, no, no.

31
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:14,746
Uh-uh.
Lily, it's not you.

32
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:15,986
I-it, it's us.
Yeah.

33
00:01:15,987 --> 00:01:17,121
It's us.

34
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:18,293
You understand, right?

35
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:20,365
Sure, of course.

36
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:23,040
As long as you're happy,
I'm happy.

37
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,920
We were gonna take
cooking lessons together

38
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,595
and we were gonna go
on camping trips together

39
00:01:30,596 --> 00:01:34,139
and then we were gonna sit
around telling funny stories

40
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,449
about our cooking lessons
and our camping trips.

41
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,224
I know, I know.

42
00:01:42,465 --> 00:01:45,641
So, has the boat sailed
on sex tonight or...

43
00:01:48,094 --> 00:01:51,404
<i>After that, the summer
went by way too fast.</i>

44
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:53,074
<i>Until all of a sudden,
it was the Friday</i>

45
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:55,115
<i>before my first day
as a college professor.</i>

46
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,623
Whoa, what's this?
Oh, boy.

47
00:01:57,624 --> 00:02:00,263
It's just a little something
that we got for you

48
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:04,377
that used to belong to my
favorite professor of all time.

49
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:09,257
A fedora.

50
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:16,845
I'm Indiana Jones... I'm Indiana Jones!

51
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:19,754
That, my friend,
is the Dominator 8000,

52
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:22,563
the best bullwhip on the market,
according to my whip guy.

53
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,739
Yeah, I have a whip guy.

54
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,311
You know what we should do?
We should...

55
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:30,387
...Finish our drinks, go out
in the alley, and whip stuff.

56
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:33,062
God, you just get me.

57
00:02:33,897 --> 00:02:36,036
Okay, I should get going.
I got a date.

58
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:37,740
Oh, are you still
seeing that guy?

59
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,812
Uh, even better,
seeing him naked.

60
00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:40,182
What!
Oh!

61
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:41,454
I should go, too.

62
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:43,658
I hooked up with this
Chinese girl last night,

63
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:47,572
and I don't know, it's weird.
I already feel like seconds.

64
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:51,195
Okay, Ted, you got first whip!

65
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:52,231
All right.

66
00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:54,204
Hey, dummy.

67
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,779
What did tell you
about smoking in here?

68
00:02:57,816 --> 00:02:58,917
Make him whip the habit!

69
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:00,256
I'so excited about this whip!

70
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:01,727
I got whip fever!

71
00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:02,762
Just whip him, Ted!

72
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:03,798
Don't even aim!

73
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:04,770
Just whip him!

74
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:06,072
I am so sorry.

75
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:07,442
No, it's just the whip's
not a toy, Ted.

76
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:09,082
There's such a thing
as common sense, you know.

77
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,054
Hey, you can whip me
if you want.

78
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:13,563
I will, some other time.

79
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:19,915
Whoo!

80
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:24,551
Sync by vNaru

81
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,723
So, how long has
this been going on?

82
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:39,427
All summer.

83
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,564
I knew it!

84
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:41,836
I knew it! I knew it!

85
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:44,576
<i>You guys are boyfriend
and girlfriend.</i>

86
00:03:44,577 --> 00:03:45,748
Whoa, hey.
Whoa.

87
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:47,318
Wow, no.
Whoa...

88
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,589
Whoa, whoa, whoa... Lily.
Girlfriend?

89
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,063
Slow your roll there,
Lilypad. Yeah, yeah.

90
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,671
You've been together all summer.
I dot get it.

91
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:55,743
Okay, it's like this.

92
00:03:55,744 --> 00:03:58,351
After we kissed,
we sat down to have The Talk.

93
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:01,393
We should figure out
what this is.

94
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:02,665
Yes, we should.

95
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,767
Or...

96
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:05,607
Or...

97
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,020
<i>Okay, now, we have
to figure this out.</i>

98
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:11,758
Yes, we do.

99
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,631
Or. Or...

100
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:18,478
Whoa!

101
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:20,566
We kept trying to have the talk

102
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:22,506
and then we realized
we hate the talk.

103
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:24,110
Yeah, the talk sucks.

104
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:26,183
You have to, like, talk.

105
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,921
And be all, "I don't know.

106
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:29,358
"It's not that
I don't like you.

107
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,862
"It's just that I haven't
had a girlfriend

108
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:31,965
"in a really long time.

109
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:33,372
I hope that doesn't
make you mad."

110
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,942
Who needs it?

111
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,380
You needs it.

112
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:37,483
Guys, you can't

113
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:38,719
just keep hooking up

114
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,391
and not at least
try and figure out

115
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:41,597
what you mean to each other.

116
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:43,468
Yeah, we knew
you would say that.

117
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:44,873
That's why we kept it a secret.

118
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:46,243
We, that and the fact

119
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,984
that elaborate lies
really turn us on.

120
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:50,923
No, no, no. No.

121
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,798
You need to define
the relationship.

122
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,400
You need to have the talk.

123
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,909
Or. Or..

124
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:02,660
I know what you're all thinking.

125
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:05,870
"Who's this cool peer of mine
up in front the class?"

126
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,310
Well, I know the board says

127
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:11,552
"Professor Mosby," but to you

128
00:05:11,553 --> 00:05:14,294
I'm Ted, huh?

129
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:17,134
Question. Awesome.

130
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:19,007
Hit it.
Yeah, here's my question.

131
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:22,218
"Ted," who the hell
do you think you are?

132
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:24,155
Yeah, "Ted."

133
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:25,794
We're supposed to learn
from you?

134
00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:27,399
You failed as an architect.

135
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,435
Well...

136
00:05:28,436 --> 00:05:29,371
And if you're a professor,

137
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:30,742
where's your hat and your whip?

138
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:32,212
They're at home.
I didn't think I'd need...

139
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:33,686
And where are your pants?

140
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:38,633
Oh!

141
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:39,736
Oh, God.

142
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:41,842
Barney, it was awful.
I was teaching...

143
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:43,447
Shh, Ted, now's
not a good time.

144
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:45,622
Whe do you keep your condoms?

145
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,067
I'm freeking out, I don't
think I can do this

146
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:51,504
Okay, look, mistake #1

147
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:53,310
was taking that
girl's question.

148
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,247
You don't take questions
on the first day.

149
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:56,286
It shows weakness.

150
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,759
Mistake #2

151
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,600
was you should've hit that.

152
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,534
Dude, your pants
were already off,

153
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:03,380
you had a classroom full
of people to cheer you on,

154
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,909
and you can't knock her up
'cause it's a dream.

155
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,721
Class dismissed.

156
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:10,027
Mistake #3:
Dude, where was the hat?

157
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:12,402
Because if you're not gonna
wear it I'm taking it back.

158
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:14,474
I think what Barney's
saying is that

159
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:15,978
definitions are important.

160
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:17,984
You're their teacher,
not their friend.

161
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:18,975
Exactly.

162
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:20,429
If people don't know their place,

163
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:21,619
nobody's happy.

164
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,155
Amen.

165
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:24,694
You have to make things clear.

166
00:06:24,695 --> 00:06:25,763
Run tell dat.

167
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:27,936
Define the relationship.

168
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,508
Yes! No!

169
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,314
Lily, private convo time.

170
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,358
Lily, can't you just
let us be happy?

171
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,763
You're not happy.

172
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:41,205
You just think you're happy
because you feel happy.

173
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:43,076
And that's not happy?

174
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:44,079
Of course not.

175
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,118
You and Robin need
to have the talk.

176
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:48,826
Why? Give me one good reason.
I'll give you 20...

177
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:50,732
Wow, you can't even
think of one.

178
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,036
Headlights. Deer.

179
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,376
Lily, for the last time,

180
00:06:54,377 --> 00:06:57,720
things with me and Robin are
as good as they can possibly be.

181
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:59,092
Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.

182
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:01,330
I've got two tickets

183
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:03,070
to the Rangers/Canucks game
tomorrow night.

184
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:05,609
I know you're a hockey fan,
so I was thinkin'...

185
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,282
Uh, oh, um...

186
00:07:07,283 --> 00:07:08,551
Uh...

187
00:07:08,552 --> 00:07:09,757
What do I have to do?

188
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:11,161
Put a gun to your head?

189
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,135
Buy you a six pack?

190
00:07:14,136 --> 00:07:15,473
Oh, come on, Brad, that's...

191
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:17,680
Wow, there's really
six of them.

192
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:20,388
Uh, but... Uh, I can't.

193
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:22,127
Why not?
You have a boyfriend?

194
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:25,169
No. No, no boyfriend.

195
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,108
Great! It's a date.

196
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:29,582
Hey, Barn.
Hey, Brad...

197
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:34,144
I just thought of a reason

198
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,607
<i>The next night, Robin and Brad
went to a hockey game.</i>

199
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:45,850
You're probably wondering
why I've been quiet all night.

200
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:47,588
Um...

201
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:48,624
Damn it, Hordichuk!

202
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,928
You miss another gimme
like that,

203
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:51,166
I'm gonna come down there

204
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:54,476
and put a slapper right up
ur beerhole! Come on!

205
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:55,813
Not really.

206
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:57,585
The truth is,

207
00:07:57,586 --> 00:07:59,892
I- I feel kind of weird
being out with you.

208
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:01,463
Oh, man.

209
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:02,735
Is this the talk?

210
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:04,539
What?
No, this is good.

211
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,144
Let's get it all
out of the way.

212
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:08,551
Robin, I'm looking
for something serious.

213
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:10,256
No, Brad, no, it's...

214
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,064
But before we go any further,
you should know something

215
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:14,335
about my stuff below the belt.

216
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:16,207
I was born a little different.

217
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,678
God, no, uh,

218
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,149
Brad, no, um...

219
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,992
This I-is about me and
Barney.
You and Barn...

220
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:24,131
Oh, oh, so you, you guys are...

221
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:25,701
Well, we-we-we don't
know what we are.

222
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:27,542
I mean, my heart says
"leap into it."

223
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:29,882
My brain says
"it's a bad idea."

224
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:31,856
Sounds like you guys
need to have the talk.

225
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:34,180
We're not gonna have the talk!

226
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,655
Would you just
have the talk, okay?

227
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:38,225
It's a five-minute conversation,

228
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,964
and then you get
to have sex afterwards.

229
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:41,835
It's great! Back me up, Ted.

230
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:43,975
I don't think
the talk is necessary.

231
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:46,182
What?!
Thank you, Ted.

232
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:48,489
Because Robin is already
his girlfriend.

233
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,793
What?!

234
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:52,536
MacLaren's Bar,
four years ago...

235
00:08:52,838 --> 00:08:55,478
How do you keep a girl
from becoming your girlfriend

236
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:57,049
Simple: the rules for girls

237
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,589
are the same as the rules for gremlins

238
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,992
"Gremlins"?

239
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:01,697
Gremlins. Rule #1:

240
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:03,535
Never get them wet.

241
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:05,978
In other words, don't let her
take a shower at your place.

242
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,517
♪2: keep them away
from sunlight...

243
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:11,191
<i>i. e. don't ever see them
during the day.</i>

244
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:14,001
And rule #3:
Never feed them after midnight.

245
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:15,639
Meaning she doesn't sleep over

246
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,480
<i>and you don't have breakfast
with her. Ever.</i>

247
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:20,990
What about brunch?
Is brunch cool?

248
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:25,267
No, Ted.
Brunch is not cool.

249
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:27,842
Ok, new topic.

250
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:29,080
How do I pick a tie?

251
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:31,620
<i>Simple: remember
in the movie Predator...</i>

252
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:36,401
I've done all three
of those things with Robin.

253
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:38,273
Is she my girlfriend?

254
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:43,556
Just once, I wish you guys
would call me on Tuxedo Night.

255
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:47,146
Ladies and gentlemen,
time to pucker up

256
00:09:47,215 --> 00:09:49,220
for the New York Rangers
Kiss Cam!

257
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:53,015
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

258
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:54,587
Okay, how about this?

259
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,460
If you kiss me and you
feel bad about it,

260
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:57,698
you're meant to be with Barney.

261
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:00,841
Why not? Lay it on me.

262
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:02,377
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

263
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:04,218
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

264
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:06,925
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

265
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:08,231
Hey, Brad.

266
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:12,075
Brad, we can't fight
like this all night!

267
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:14,916
We both got some good shots in.
Let's call a truce!

268
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:16,521
It's okay, dude.

269
00:10:16,522 --> 00:10:18,360
I shouldn't go kissing
some other guy's girlfriend.

270
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:20,901
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, girlfriend?

271
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:22,037
He come on.

272
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,339
That's putting it
a bit strongly.

273
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,248
A bit strongly. She's no
Okay, yeah.

274
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,353
A gifriend's
a bit much, Brad, okay?

275
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,339
Okay, seriously.

276
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,214
We're at the point
of physical violence.

277
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,555
Now, will you please
have the talk?

278
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:36,958
<i>Because of that?</i>

279
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,730
Come on. That's my thing.

280
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:40,637
I'm always punching guys.
Mm-hmm.

281
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:43,412
Girls- I'll punch a baby.
I don't care.

282
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:47,881
<i>Finally, my first class
had arrived.</i>

283
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:49,183
<i>For real this time.</i>

284
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:50,889
<i>I knew I had to make
a strong impression.</i>

285
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,529
<i>I had thought of everything.</i>

286
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,334
<i>Except...</i>

287
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,473
<i>Wait. Does professor
have one "F" or two?</i>

288
00:10:56,474 --> 00:10:58,379
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

289
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,683
<i>Professor.</i>

290
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:01,054
<i>Pro-fess-or.</i>

291
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:02,626
<i>They're all staring at me.</i>

292
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:05,100
<i>Professor.
Uh, I don't know.</i>

293
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:07,573
<i>Just do something!</i>

294
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,256
<i>Two "F's."
That looks right.</i>

295
00:11:10,257 --> 00:11:11,727
<i>I think that's right.</i>

296
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,758
Hey, sorry I went little
too far last night.

297
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:30,796
Oh, look, we've been over this.

298
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:32,672
Unless I say "flugelhorn,"
you haven't gone too far.

299
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:36,390
No, I meant punching Brad.

300
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:38,329
Oh, right. Look,
don't even worry about it.

301
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,201
It's... oh. God.

302
00:11:40,202 --> 00:11:41,772
The doorknob's broken off.

303
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:43,411
We're locked in here.

304
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,417
Did, did you do this?
No.

305
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:48,259
Flugelhorn.
Did you do this?

306
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,431
No.

307
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,608
Ted? Ted, are you out there?

308
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:55,648
Ted's not here, Robin.

309
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,420
Lily, let us out of here.

310
00:11:57,421 --> 00:11:58,791
I'd be glad to.

311
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,801
Just as soon as you
and Barney have the talk.

312
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:09,260
Lily! Come on.
Let us out!

313
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,865
No. Sit down,

314
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:13,004
define the relationship,
write down

315
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:14,912
that definition
on a piece of paper,

316
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:16,281
slip it under the door,

317
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:18,889
and if I like what I read,
you can go.

318
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:20,995
We are not having the talk!

319
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:22,032
Then you'll die in there.

320
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,569
You're gonna lock us in here?

321
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,741
Well, guess what?

322
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:27,146
Maybe we'll spend
the whole day having sex!

323
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,819
Well, guess what?

324
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,761
I brought Marshall with me,
so maybe we'll do the same.

325
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:33,902
Hey, guys.

326
00:12:35,907 --> 00:12:37,042
<i>I still hadn't decided</i>

327
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:39,017
<i>what kind of professor
I wanted to be-</i>

328
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:41,323
<i>authoritative or cool guy.</i>

329
00:12:41,324 --> 00:12:43,241
<i>I thought I would decide
in the moment.</i>

330
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:45,578
And I did. About 20 times.

331
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:47,319
Good morning.

332
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:49,483
'Sup, dudes?

333
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:51,558
Silence!

334
00:12:52,694 --> 00:12:54,498
This is Architecture 101.

335
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:57,307
I am Professor Mosby.

336
00:12:57,308 --> 00:13:00,014
But you can call me Ted.

337
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:02,990
Professor Mosby.

338
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,196
T- Dawg.

339
00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:07,338
Do not call me T-Dawg.

340
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:12,184
Never take questions
on the first day.

341
00:13:12,185 --> 00:13:13,623
It shows weakness.

342
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:14,960
Also,

343
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,937
don't look right here.

344
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,283
Okay, good luck. Byesies.

345
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:26,226
<i>This was it:
My crossroads moment.</i>

346
00:13:26,227 --> 00:13:29,101
<i>What kind of professor
was I gonna be</i>

347
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:30,840
<i>I had to decide.</i>

348
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:33,716
Please save all your qstions
until the end of the lecture.

349
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:35,153
Thank you!

350
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:36,256
Now...

351
00:13:36,257 --> 00:13:37,995
<i>Professor Mosby had arrived.</i>

352
00:13:37,996 --> 00:13:40,437
<i>Of course, if I had taken
that girl's question-</i>

353
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:42,542
<i>who, by the way, was not your mom</i>

354
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:44,146
<i>Your mom was sitting...</i>

355
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:46,186
<i>Wait, let me finish this real quick.</i>

356
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:48,225
<i>Here's what
that girl wod have said.</i>

357
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:50,734
I'm sorry to bother you, Professor Mosby

358
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:53,441
but this isn't Architecture 101.

359
00:13:53,442 --> 00:13:55,179
This is Economics 305.

360
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,985
You're in the wrong classroom.

361
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:58,957
<i>Yes, I was
in the wrong classroom.</i>

362
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,227
<i>And thus began</i>

363
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:02,235
<i>the most humiliating
seven minutes of my life.</i>

364
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:04,474
Here's your think-about-it
for the day.

365
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:07,015
Every single person
in this room

366
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:09,690
is already an architect.

367
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:11,730
Architect?

368
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,079
Hmm. Ooh.

369
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,918
"We're just hanging out."

370
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,492
Just hanging out?

371
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,430
Not good enough.

372
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:24,870
Not good enough!

373
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:33,194
Can anyone here tell me what
this class is really all about?

374
00:14:33,195 --> 00:14:34,766
Economics?

375
00:14:36,403 --> 00:14:37,641
No. No, no. Don't laugh.

376
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:40,081
He's not...
He's not entirely wrong.

377
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:42,755
An architect must be economical

378
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,795
in his use of space,

379
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:47,604
so, well done.

380
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:50,546
<i>Looks like somone's building</i>

381
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:53,622
towards an A, huh?

382
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,899
"We're seeing
where things are going."

383
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:01,144
<i>I'll tell you
where things aren't going-</i>

384
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:02,648
out of that bedroom.

385
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:04,053
Not good enough.

386
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:07,362
Not good enough!

387
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:09,068
You...

388
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:10,773
why do you want
to be an architect?

389
00:15:10,774 --> 00:15:13,380
I don't want to be an architect.

390
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:16,122
Yes. Yes, exactly.

391
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,224
It-It's not something

392
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:18,427
<i>you want to be.</i>

393
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:20,135
<i>It's something you need to be.</i>

394
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,705
You dot have a choice, right?

395
00:15:21,706 --> 00:15:24,347
None of you has a choice

396
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:26,619
No questions!

397
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,363
"We're Barnman and Robin."

398
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:34,778
Oh, come on, you got to admit,
that's kind of funny, Lily.

399
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:37,085
Not good enough.

400
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:39,927
Not good enough!

401
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:41,736
So if any of you

402
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:44,008
have even
the slightest inclination

403
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,285
to do anything with your life
other than become an architect,

404
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:49,893
you're wasting my time
and yours.

405
00:15:49,894 --> 00:15:51,297
There's the door

406
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:52,903
You can go.

407
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,225
I'm serious. Get out, now!

408
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:01,226
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

409
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,933
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't-Don't all leave!

410
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:04,804
Architecture's
fun! Look!

411
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:06,041
I brought a hacky sack!

412
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:07,313
Sorry, I'm late, everyone.

413
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:08,916
My name is Professor Calzonetti.

414
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,454
This is Economics 305.

415
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:11,994
You may return to your seats.

416
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:14,500
Uh, sorry, sir.

417
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:16,539
This is, uh, Architecture 101.

418
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,219
Who invited their dad, right?

419
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:20,516
Young man,

420
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:21,798
for the last 28 years,

421
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,937
Economics 305 has been taught
right here

422
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:26,612
in building 14, room 7.

423
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:27,983
Uh, yeah.

424
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:30,223
Buddy, I'm sure
200 architecture students

425
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:33,031
and their professor
all got the room wrong.

426
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:34,871
T- Dawg,
you're in the wrong room, bro.

427
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:43,730
College kids, out of the way
Sorry. Coming through.

428
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:50,618
Excuse me. Whoa.

429
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:57,492
20 minutes late
on your first day?

430
00:16:57,493 --> 00:16:59,130
That's rough.
Mm.

431
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:00,702
Yeah, but here's
the funny thing.

432
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:02,408
<i>By that point,
I didn't have time</i>

433
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:04,948
<i>to think about what kind
of teacher I was going to be.</i>

434
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,257
<i>I just got up there
and talked about architecture.</i>

435
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:09,496
And it was kind of great.

436
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:11,134
That's awesome, Ted.
Yeah.

437
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:12,203
Congratulations, buddy.

438
00:17:12,204 --> 00:17:13,005
Thanks.

439
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:14,175
Nice job, Ted.

440
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:15,514
Hey, Ted, door five!

441
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:18,523
Were you there?
Yeah, I got you, buddy.

442
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:20,763
They still haven't
had the talk, huh?

443
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:24,607
I think I know
how to speed things up

444
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:30,492
Oh, not cool!

445
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:35,105
Pancakes, fresh bacon.

446
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:38,347
It is so yummy.

447
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,788
Uh, dude,
I'm starving. Let's...

448
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:42,527
Let's just have the stupid talk.

449
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,965
Come on.
Fine.

450
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:45,536
But

451
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:47,074
how do these this even work?

452
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:48,179
What do we say?

453
00:17:53,494 --> 00:17:54,023
Huh.

454
00:17:54,102 --> 00:17:56,205
Where do you see this relationship going?

455
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:58,295
Oh, my God,
that sounds so cheesy.

456
00:17:58,514 --> 00:17:59,785
I know, right?

457
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:01,958
Totally. But, um,

458
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:05,501
<i>where-where do you see
this relationship going?</i>

459
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:08,718
I don't know.

460
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,105
I mean,

461
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:10,263
it's not like I don't like you.

462
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:12,635
I just haven't had a girlfriend
for a long time.

463
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,329
I hope
that doesn't make you mad.

464
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,666
Mad?

465
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:17,872
I feel the same way.

466
00:18:17,873 --> 00:18:19,174
I suck at relationships.

467
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:19,944
I mean,

468
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:21,413
except with Ted.

469
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:24,390
Man, he really got it right.

470
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:25,761
I know it's a cliche

471
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:28,086
but he really ruined me
for other men.

472
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:30,804
<i>Of course, I wasn't in the room
for this conversation,</i>

473
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:33,278
<i>but I have to imagine
Robin said something like that.</i>

474
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:37,088
Maybe we should go back
to being just friends.

475
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:38,561
Maybe.

476
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,800
But, um,

477
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:42,672
I don't want
to stop having sex.

478
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:44,177
Oh, good. Me, neither.

479
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:47,184
Yeah. Friends
isn't gonna work.

480
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:48,655
Nope. Oh, we're not good
at being friends.

481
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:50,293
We're not good at being
in a relationship.

482
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:51,466
Why are we good at?

483
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:53,705
I know something we're good at.

484
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:55,007
I don't know. If we're
gonna do it again,

485
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,113
I'm gonna need
some Gatorade, or...

486
00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:58,252
No! No, not that.

487
00:18:58,253 --> 00:18:59,824
Lying. Okay, think about it.

488
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:02,397
We spent the whole summer lying
about being just friends.

489
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:04,840
Why not just keep lying?

490
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,464
Really?
Yeah.

491
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:16,306
Really. We sat down.
We had the talk.

492
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:17,844
Barney's my boyfriend now.

493
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:19,182
And Robin's my girlfriend.

494
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:22,157
I know it sounds nuts,
but it feels good to say.

495
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:25,199
We're both afraid of commitment,
but, the fact is,

496
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,039
we also can't live
without each other.

497
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,078
And if the alternative
is not being together,

498
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,285
then it's worth taking
this risk 'cause...

499
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,145
...she's awesome.

500
00:19:35,146 --> 00:19:36,616
And he's awesome.

501
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:38,689
He looks nice in a suit.

502
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,995
She can handle her Scotch.

503
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:42,667
He's my boyfriend.

504
00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:44,608
And she's my girlfriend.

505
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,430
Oh!

506
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:54,972
Good enough!

507
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,762
She bought it.

508
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:01,167
Hook, line, and sinker.
We are good.

509
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:02,539
Oh, totally. Mm.

510
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,480
So, you want
to get some breakfast?

511
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:07,321
You know, brunch actuall
does sound kind of good.

512
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:10,195
Hmm. Well, lead the way,
sweetie pie.

513
00:20:10,196 --> 00:20:11,734
Wow! Flugelhorn.

514
00:20:11,735 --> 00:20:13,372
Yeah, that felt wrong.
Mm.

515
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:15,580
Mm.

516
00:20:23,738 --> 00:20:26,779
You do realize
they were lying, right?

517
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,350
No, Ted.

518
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:30,758
They don't realize
they weren't lying.

519
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,062
Oh, hello.

520
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:45,733
Hello. Good evening.

521
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:47,203
Hello. Don't get up.

522
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,775
Didn't we meet on a yacht?

523
00:20:48,776 --> 00:20:50,414
Hello.

524
00:20:52,688 --> 00:20:54,459
What?

525
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,663
Oh, no!

526
00:20:55,664 --> 00:20:58,405
Did I not tell you guys
that it was Tuxedo Night?

527
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:03,186
Doesn't feel
very good, does it?
